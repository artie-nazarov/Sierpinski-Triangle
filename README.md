# Sierpinski Triangle Simulator
## What is it?
**The Sierpiński triangle** (sometimes spelled Sierpinski), also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. <br>

## So... what is it?
Using a randomized and similarly abstract algorithm we will simulate very interesting triangular patterns. <br>
You can see the result in the **Simulation** section.
## Algorithm
1. Pick 3 points on a grid to form an equilateral triangle **T**.
2. Pick a random point within **T**.
3. We are now at our starting point **p**.
4. Pick a random point **r** from the initial 3 points that formed **T**.
5. Imagine a line going from **p** to **r**. Draw a new point in the middle of that line.
6. Our new point is our new starting point. Repeat from step 3!
